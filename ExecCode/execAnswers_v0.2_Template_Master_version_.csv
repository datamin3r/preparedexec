ay29const_Q2_16_22,And you can call it leading or not leading. We are sort of I would say marching to our own beat as opposed to too worried about what some of our competitors are doing overall. And that's sort of up to them. And we will do what we think the market will bear for our brands and what's good for the health of our brands.,Rob Sands,,1,,,
y31_HEINY_Q4_16_55,"Yes. I want to be crystal clear on that management is appointed by the board, and has the full competence of the board to carry these forward. That's one. Secondly, SEBI has issued a executive order to this mister Chairman of the Board out of his function. It's not the will of the shareholders to do it nor on board of directors, it is just a court order that have to be executed. It's for Dr. Mallya to react on that if he wants to have a stay on that position.",Jean-Francois van Boxmeer,,2,,,
_the_Pres_09_16_108,"What we're seeing is it's positive for the brand equity. We also have figured out a lot of the principles how to merchandise, which makes sure that as you launch the new product, you use it as a big platform to merchandise your core range and drive sales of that.",John Kennedy,,3,,,
_BrownF.B_Q1_16_55,"It certainly was an element of our - what I'll call rest of the portfolio outside of the Jack Daniel's brand having a very good quarter. If you look at the - and that's a rest of portfolio, I know you are referring to Schedule B, I am talking about everything, other than Jack Daniel's. And the Tequila has had a really good quarter that might be one of the contributing factors, Woodford Reserve, it gets larger and the larger it gets and the more it grows at 26%, the more it makes contributions, it's not specifically called out here, but even contributions from brands like Old Forester, Sonoma Cutrer, et cetera. Yes, it was a good quarter for the non-Jack Daniel's brands. But I also don't want to take away from the fact that we expect the Jack Daniel's family and particularly Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey over the balance of the year to post better numbers than the 3% that was in there. So, but I think it's a fair comment. I mean, it was a good quarter and there were some, as all these brands have when you just look at 90 days at the beginning of a year, you have all kinds of things that are influencing sort of a quarterly number. So, I wouldn't expect or for example, our Tequilas to continue to run at those rates for the full year. But nonetheless we do think they are performing better than they were in the recent past.",Paul Varga,,4,,,
y31_HEINY_Q2_16_16,"Competitive dynamics will change for sure and it's going to be depending on who is the acquirer but then it starts to be speculation. But specifically let me repeat to your private equity thing, typically you need also an exit for that and you would not acquire it for a cheap price in a market which is very competitive, but its only speculation.",Jean-Francois van Boxmeer,,5,,,
_may31_TSRYY_17_44,"We've also adjusted our spends down, our cost of doing business in Europe which is why we feel pretty confident we can continue to hit double digit EBITS margins because we're managing - we're matching our investments and our costs to what that portfolio is that we are selling. And I would say that double digit EBITS margin on any commercial business anywhere in the world is tremendous. So hitting 12% EBITS margin is great.",Michael Clarke,,6,,,
_BrownF.B_Q3_17_16,"I know at our company, we're a little bit more cautious, and even in the instances where we took pricing this past year with Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, in the short-term, they felt the impact on the shelf once the prices got in there, and I think it's a reflection of the fact that there are alternatives out there. I mean, there's just a lot of competition in this U.S. bourbon and spirits market, and when there's a lot of choice, it makes pricing a little bit more difficult.",Paul Varga,,7,,,
may31_TAP_Q1_16_1,"Yeah, I was going to say, Bryan, we're focused on the moment of closing the brewery down and transitioning the volume to where it's supposed to be. That's our focus, here. And we just haven't made any decisions on what to do with a facility or the land at this point.",Gavin Hattersley,,8,,,
_may31_TSRYY_17_6,"The way to think about it is we sold the Tier 2 brands at the beginning of this year that's about a 1 million cases that we've offloaded, we've not reset the prior year number, so that's the first piece. Second piece is, don't forget we are also allocating some of our wines, not only the old TWE wines which are refreshed plus the new Diageo refreshed wines we're allocating some of those wines to Asia and other parts of the world. And then we are looking at investing and growing the portfolio in both America and also in outside of America.",Michael Clarke,,9,,,
_the_Pres_09_16_111,"The comments I made about the strategy we have well executed, giving us the opportunity to sustain the performance we've had, grow market share, deliver low single-digit growth, stands. And we are getting on with executing against those with confidence and energy. Look forward to speaking to you on the next call, if not before. Take care.",John Kennedy,,10,,,
y31_HEINY_Q4_14_68,So it's a very city-by-city approach and our commercial policy is geared to go where the growth is and enhance the growth. That is -- that's basically what we are doing.,Jean-Francois van Boxmeer,,11,,,
may31_TAP_Q2_16_6,"And as for the PACC model, of course, we're constantly updating the cost of capital that we would use to analyze and review the various alternatives, i.e. should we delever, should we invest behind our brands, or should we pursue certain M&A opportunities, or should we return money to shareholders. And obviously those rates will be adjusted and are adjusted accordingly, given what's happening in the market and our outlook going forward.",Mauricio Restrepo,,12,,,
_edit_DEO_q4_14_22,"And just a follow-up on that -- and maybe this just boils down to comparison, but spirits is decelerating, at least from your perspective, on a total industry basis. Beer is accelerating. So again, it's not like spirits is losing share, but the pace of share-taking is moderating a bit. And I'm just wondering, is that a function of what's going on in vodka? Is it purely comparison? Is it the on-trade dynamic? It just seems like that trend that's been so favorable is starting to reverse a little bit in favor of beer at the expense of spirits.",Ivan M. Menezes,,13,,,
may29_DEO_q2_15_20,"Sure. Hi, Andrea. On the depletions going forward, if you look at the U.S. portfolio in total, clearly, Regal Apple had a very strong influence on the fiscal '15 performance. But we've got more momentum in the portfolio. So if you look at brands like Bulleit, our tequila portfolio, Buchanan's, etc. they're strong but the key difference makers in terms of fiscal '16 will be to get relatively better performance from Smirnoff than we had in fiscal '15. And a big one is Captain Morgan, which is your second question, which I can talk to. On Captain Morgan, firstly outside the U.S., Captain Morgan is very strong and doing very well. In the U.S., the rum category is tough and Captain is in the most recent periods, is holding share. So we've stabilized it. But as we go into fiscal '16, we have a new campaign in place, which we're very excited about. It's called GO FULL CAPTAIN and it basically says in this age where 21 to 24 years olds have a lot of anxiety and social media and digital and staying up with everyone, we're going to put the fun back into their lives with the Captain.",Ivan Menezes,,14,,,
31_Pernod_Q1_16_26,"And I think that in our mid-term objective, to obviously come back to growth in China, we're confident that Cordon Bleu will play an important role because we have Noblige well on track and on Cordon Bleu everything we're doing, everything we've been doing in the last 12 months will help to improve the performance of Cordon Bleu and XO going forwards. And in particular in the on-trade, in particular in Chinese restaurants which have a tremendous potential for Cordon Bleu going forward.",Gilles Bogaert,,15,,,
may29_DEO_q4_16_27,"Yes. Ed, on the stock question, I mean, there are some technical factors, which you'll see a bounce-back, where we had reduced stock levels. But on an ongoing basis to your question about as the emerging markets come back or scotch gets stronger, we are very focused on really having everyone's eye and measurement and incentives and data around what's selling out and depleting, and really managing the stock levels and distributors very tightly as a result.",Ivan Menezes,,16,,,
_may31_TSRYY_17_1,"Also some parts of the market not included in Aztec but if you were to look to do this but if you were going to have a conversation with I think most of our retail partners in Australia, I think they would all confirm that we have grown share in this market.",Gunther Burghardt,,17,,,
may29_DEO_q2_15_12,"Hi, Trevor, thanks. Let me take the first two questions. On the NSV guidance of mid-single digits, the way we see the world is getting the U.S. back to, let's say, mid-single digits, 4, 5, 6, and we see by F17 very much all the fundamentals that we're putting in place and the changes we're making in the U.S. with things like the Activation Army and our incubation of brands. And we'll talk more about this at the investor conference in November, so that's leg number one. Leg number two is Europe's steady. Europe has come back to growth this year, Western Europe, that's one, holding that above there.",Ivan Menezes,,18,,,
_BrownF.B_Q4_16_11,"And there was a huge surge in interest and trial associated with this product and as you can image, I just feel like just composition of the product it's not going to be for every straight whiskey drinker because it's in fact a flavored whiskey. And so I really do - it doesn't surprise us that there are tough quarters following a launch like that in a particular country. But I do feel we have the benefit of expanding it geographically to partially offset that. ",Paul Varga,,19,,,
_BrownF.B_Q1_16_66,"Well, I don't know that the boom-bust on flavored vodkas, boom was 20 years, and it busted then more recently. But the initial entries into flavored vodka back at the early days of Absolut and Stoli, to some extent Finlandia was back around then in the United States, goes back quite sometime. So, and it became a prominent part of the category growing to what I recall, something like 20% or something of the total category. I think flavored vodka today if you were to independently review it as a category it would be huge. And so, if you - of course, that took some time as well. What can we do - I can't speak as an industry, I can only speak to what we can do as a corporation and how we responsibly develop the category and the brands and the way that I feel about it is to treat the entrants in there even though they have in these cases might be line extensions as bonafide brands. And, when you do that it takes you into a consideration of how are you managing - in this case to get truly new consumption to the category and so - I kind of referenced this in my comments that we are prepared that the success we've had and I'll just use the United States in this example of being able to attract new consumers through both Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and from what we are seeing in the early days of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, to not only the whiskey category but to the Jack Daniel's brand without cannibalizing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. I find that it's - and we are looking at it from a bunch of different angles, it's very different than say, in the soda business of diet sodas versus mainland sodas or a light beer versus mainland beer where they are with the passage of time was considerable cannibalization as one went up and the other went down and so far because, these are occupying quite different drinking occasions, we think if you build the brands in a - I think a constructive way and have that in mind, you will have a more prolonged existence as an expression of it, in this case, the Jack Daniel's trademark. So that's what we can do. I can tell you, we are not going to be introducing a brand every three months in order to chase numbers or something like that. It's just not - it would be responsible to the Jack Daniel's trademark. I think there is a statistic we've been using that Tennessee Honey by itself, when you consider brands that average retail around the world for $25 and above, is something like the 16s or 18s or something like that largest brand because it occupies - I think at year-end it was about 1.4 million cases and that is a very significant amount of business and so, I don't want to really treat this some line extension of Jack Daniel's. You really have to think about how it can continue to be a prominent brand in the global marketplace. I think the other thing sort of - we have had some unique experience with here is that there is a lot of - of course natural focus on this emerging 7, 8 million case and growing flavored whiskey market in the United States. When you leave the United States, Tennessee Honey has played a very prominent role, it's not the lead role, in developing the flavored whiskey category outside the United States. And so, we think there - that's why we continue to test and read it very closely, so that we can expand the world that's possible for flavored whiskey from just over 300 million people to perhaps 7 billion people. We can - and so we really are taking a very long-term, even though it's a really dynamic category where there is a lot of competition, a lot of change, and a lot of new entrants that will make a bunch of noise, I think what we intent to continue to build it along the lines of the way we treated Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey with a very long-term view and trying to create incremental value for Brown-Forman. That helps Ian?",Paul Varga,,20,,,
y31_HEINY_Q2_16_40,"That is a very good question. But at the same time, I don't think it's the place to make speculations about that. Part of what you do is strategy, part of what you do is in reaction of strategies and actions of others. That is -- and when you speak about a discretionary part of our business it is exactly that, it's the ATL and BTL it's totally discretionary. When you have to produce a hectoliter of beer, it's not discretionary.",Jean-Francois van Boxmeer,,21,,,
_may29abi_Q1_16_25,"No. I mean, it's not this year, but it's fair to say that top-line has been growing in terms of importance, top-line growth, in the past few years. Not this year necessarily, but in the past few years. Yes, it's fair to say that.",Carlos Alves de Brito,,22,,,
_BrownF.B_Q4_16_19,"I mean yes they might pull a quarter or two on the sales line or even in the operating income line a little bit from time to time, but the story at our company because of the development that I mentioned over the last decade or more around Jack Daniel's and our American whiskies is really where we are placing our emphasis today. ",Paul Varga,,23,,,
ay29const_Q4_16_6,"There is a lot of distribution gain activity or a lot of space we can gain in terms of distribution in the coming year. We do expect continued growth of cans and again, our objective remains to drive our can volume up in aggregate into that mid-teens kind of range of total volume over time.",David Klein,,24,,,
may31_TAP_Q2_16_40,"So, any quality of our copy, the promotional intensity in terms of our in-case, the roll out of the visual identity, further alignment with the U.S. creative platform, all of those things are very well. But this is a big, big brand and you don't turn things on or turn things off overnight. So, we are working this hard, and I think we're working on the right input measures, starting certainly through our brand tracking to demonstrate that we're pulling on the right levers, and I expect to see performance improve through the balance of this year and into 2017.",Mark Hunter,,25,,,
may29_DEO_q2_15_29,"So I don't know where you were going with that question, but I am very confident about our ability to drive a sustained performance in the U.S. and it does take more agility, it does take being ahead of understanding the consumer trends and that's really the direction in which we are shaping our U.S. business as we go forward. I'll just come back to Javier's question earlier. North American whiskey, just confirm the number; it is PS800 million growing at 12%.",Ivan Menezes,,26,,,
_may29abi_Q2_16_42,"Of course, you have some capacity constraints at the moment because, again, the Mexican supply capacity is being all taken by the growth we have in Mexico, by the growth Corona has worldwide in our system and now by the growth we have with Mexican imports from us into the U.S. markets. That's why we're building a new brewery there in the Yucatan Peninsula. We're very excited hopes to Jalisco. Let's see, early days, but some good signs, some good numbers to start with.",Carlos Brito,,27,,,
_may31_TSRYY_17_14,"And I think you can see in our U.S. numbers that even while we were in this fixing space in America, you can still see the profit impact by us. I'm getting greater margin appreciation on not only our existing TWE brands but also on the Diageo portfolio and we just have to take $1 price increase or get a $1 improvement in our trade spent and that goes across all the cases that we sell of Diageo's portfolio in the current period.",Michael Clarke,,28,,,
ay29const_Q1_16_36,"Yes. So just kind of to look at quarter-over-quarter and I will focus on Corona because remember, Modelo Especial is a big can brand, right. But the new launch is really focused on Corona Extra. And for Corona Extra, say first quarter last year, about 3% of our depletions were in cans and this year was about 5%.",Rob Sands,,29,,,
may31_TAP_Q2_16_51,"Okay. Well, if there are no questions, I'd just like to thank everybody for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. We are poised, as we look forward, to the hopeful conclusion of the ABI and SAB transaction and our acquisition of the 58% in MillerCoors, which will be transformational for our business.",Mark Hunter,,30,,,
y31_HEINY_Q4_14_15,"Negative surprises, they come in the course of the year, where you have macro or geopolitical incidents that you didn't count on. I would say that Russia has been that surprise because the events that happened in -- between Russia and Ukraine have been hurting us, but they haven't been hurting the whole industry. ",Jean-Francois van Boxmeer,,31,,,
31_Pernod_Q4_14_12,"And it's the same for other brands, including Chivas and Royal Salute. So that's what we can say on China.",Alexandre Ricard,,32,,,
y31_HEINY_Q4_14_12,"The last point on Russia and you know that, we have been of course writing off all the goodwill of the balance sheet over the last few years, so we are just carrying active assets on the ground over there.",Jean-Francois van Boxmeer,,33,,,
_BrownF.B_Q4_16_10,"And one of the offset, just - repeat something I said a few minutes ago. One of the offsets to cycling the initial interest in trial on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States is the fact that we'll be introducing it to new countries, and so that is clearly a partial of that. And it's not diminishing the fact that the US market for this category is really competitive and in this particular year, in year two of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire reminds in some ways the prior years' where there was such interest in the prior year on the launch of something where there were some pent up demand which I felt last year in the spring particularly after we've done that staged rollout. ",Paul Varga,,34,,,
ay29const_Q4_17_27,"In fact, we are 100% of their growth okay, but Constellation okay, their businesses would be going backwards and their profits would be going backwards. Where their growth driver and in many instances today, we are their largest profit contributor period.",Rob Sands,,35,,,
y31_HEINY_Q2_16_12,"As for the country mix, you're right; it affected Asia Pacific as said and then no significant impact anywhere else.",Laurence Debroux,,36,,,
ay29const_Q3_17_23,"The Board would be completely amenable to giving us any authorization that we ask for because of the fact that David mentioned was, we think that our shares are, especially today, significantly undervalued. That said, we have $800 million left on our authorization. So it's really not much of an issue at the moment. We will continue to make share repurchases opportunistically as we have in the past and the only caveat on that is that we do desire to stay within our debt target of approximately 3.5, which is also important and to therefore maintain our investment grade ratings. So that's probably the only real caveat on making stock repurchases, but hey, we are gung ho on stock repurchases. So no on needs to convince us of that strategy.",Rob Sands,,37,,,
_may29abi_Q2_16_3,"On the other hand, the premium is growing. Consumers are trading up, so that's great news and we have the brands. We're leading the premium category. We're growing double-digits and that's encouraging, so even in a weak economy, you do have consumers that are looking for that premium opportunity. So that's Brazil. In terms of the U.S., Bud Light, while we have still a lot of work to do on Bud Light, the share trend is stable but still negative. Of course, what I can tell you, Sanjeet, is that consumers are responding positively to the theme of the Bud Light Party campaign and the roll-out which is now completed, of the new Bud Light visual identity which is much more contemporary and much more in tune with the LDA consumers.",Carlos Brito,,38,,,
_BrownF.B_Q3_16_17,"The second is, with the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, our ability to take the time that we were devoting to those brand-building activities and rededicate them to our highest priorities. I made the example in my opening comments, but let's just say in this example, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey will benefit by us being able to redirect some of our time and attention and creative energies to that particular brand. That becomes, in fact, a multimillion dollar investment behind the Jack Daniel's business.",Paul Varga,,39,,,
ay29const_Q2_16_12,"Yeah. So as it relates to a new green field facility, what we've stated in the past is that, we haven't made a decision on specific location, although we are planning for Western Mexico. We haven't made a decision on size of the build-out and then we have provided a really large range of $100 to $150 a hectoliter, recognizing that a green field will be completely starting from scratch with no basic infrastructure, which we benefited from at the Nava facility. So, we will come back to you within the next several months with definitive plans around our build-out.",David Klein,,40,,,
ay29const_Q4_16_49,"And then assuming you saw positive channel mix, how much of that was driven by greater distribution in the high margin C-store channel?",Rob Sands,,41,,,
ay29const_Q3_17_4,"And on your last question, I have it here, as it relates to Ballast Point's distribution, I think Ballast Point is about 25. So ACV is about 25 and we are in about 45 states. But what I want to caution when we talk about expanding into incremental states is that if we sell a case in a state we say that we are in that state. We really need to continue to drive the sales execution and broadening of the base in each state that we go into with Ballast Point. So there is a lot of runway in front of us as it relates to Ballast Point.",David Klein,,42,,,
31_Pernod_Q2_17_11,"On your question on cost of debts yes it will go further down in the second half, partly if I get some bonds are coming to maturity and we already redeems $850 million bond in January and we are going to reimburse EUR1 billion bonds with a 5% coupon in March so this will contribute to a further decrease of the cost of debts. For fiscal year 2018 is still bit early to give you guidance, because you're trying to taking to accounts so rates increase in the U.S. but we would expect to be able to maintain lower rates maybe modestly better than the one we have for fiscal year 2017.",Gilles Bogaert,,43,,,
ay29const_Q4_17_8,"And Judy you know that pricing in beer for the most part is taken in the fourth calendar quarter of the year right. So, the pricing that -- the preponderance of the pricing that we're counting on to achieve our guidance is already in the market. ",David Klein,,44,,,
_the_Pres_09_16_22,Our third strategic priority is innovation. At this point 10% of Europe's sales now come from innovation; that's a significant increase versus three or four years ago. It has become a consistent and reliable growth driver for getting our whole Europe business back into growth.,John Kennedy,,45,,,
may29_DEO_q4_16_0,"Hi, Olivier, I'll take the first one then ask Kathy to jump in on the second. On Africa margin, yes, we were impacted by Nigeria, in particular, on the margin and in this year's organic. But going forward to your question, I do expect Africa to expand margins going forward and getting operating margin up again. So that's very much in our plans.",Ivan Menezes,,46,,,
may31_TAP_Q2_16_23,"We're working our way through that and there's a broader conversation with Gavin and the team really looking at where we want to place our bets on our own portfolio going forward, recognizing that we're kind of - we have an embarrassment of Regis with Pilsner Urquell and Peroni and [indiscernible] Staropramen potentially in the future. So, that's work that we're currently thinking our way through just now.",Mark Hunter,,47,,,
_BrownF.B_Q3_17_40,"I think the thing that's so remarkable about the Jack Daniel's share performance in the United States, when you isolate the Black Label brand, is how well it's done when you consider the additions of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, as well as Gentleman Jack, as they continued to grow in the United States and Jack Daniel's continued to grow, as well.",Paul Varga,,48,,,
_BrownF.B_Q3_16_21,But here's something you might think about as it relates to Brown-Forman and this American whiskey momentum that exists. And I actually feel like this because we have difficulty even inside of our own company or through our trade system to get our mentality just right on our expectations.,Paul Varga,,49,,,
may31_TAP_Q4_16_15,Many retailers I think are now recognizing that they have got inefficiencies on their shelf sets and too many SKUs which are too specialized and certainly the more sophisticated retailers as would come through 2016 have been asking us for support and building with their approach to Gavin and team have in our category Partnership's actually help many we tellers shift sell shots and drive efficiency and velocity appoint a purchaser think you will see that continue to 2017 and beyond and the people that one that will be the big national craft brands of corporal clarity of positioning and distinctiveness of brands like our will place.,Mark Hunter,,50,,,
ay29const_Q2_16_25,And I also say that our initial 30.5% guidance for the year actually included the benefits that we realized in the second quarter. What we didn't provide and we didn't have clear line of sight into was the timing at which we would receive these benefits.,David Klein,,51,,,
may31_TAP_Q1_16_42,"I think if you work on the basis, about half of the COGS improvement as underlying and continuing and about half of the COGS improvement in the first quarter or something that will fall away because it was a timing benefit - I don't think we whether want to get into any more of the specifics at this stage.",Mark R. Hunter,,52,,,
may31_TAP_Q4_16_10,So Gavin the only thing I would add in and Mark just for information is we wanted the decisions I've made is to take a portion of our synergies and reinvest our back into our business into our global growth team our commercial excellence team in the focused around a handful of areas so we're investing more pretty fundamental segmentation analysis which will inform an awful lot of our portfolio decision-making going forward and that's been done consistently across our business unit.,Mark Hunter,,53,,,
_BrownF.B_Q3_17_4,"In terms of the actual facility and so forth, as you know, we've been investing roughly $15 million behind this facility, which will have its own home place, bottling facility and distillery. And we're about ready to have that commissioned, I think in the springtime, it'll be commissioned. What I mean by that is we'll be producing our whiskey. So it will be ready to go to the market in three or four years from now. So we're excited about that. We're on track and stay tuned, you'll be seeing it soon.",Jane Morreau,,54,,,
may31_TAP_Q1_16_39,"The very specific response, Bryan, is that, no, we haven't disclosed anything in relation to Eden other than our plan to close the brewery. And Gavin and the team are working through the process at this point in time, and it's going as anticipated. I don't know whether, Gavin, you'd want to add anything to that?",Mark R. Hunter,,55,,,
_may31_TSRYY_17_1,"Yes, so Mike you can hear me? Basically we managed the channels very closely so we work with our online partners and try and manage the pricing very closely. We also have a different portfolio for online, there are a few products that are sold online and in traditional retail but we watched those very closely.",Robert Foye,,56,,,
_BrownF.B_Q4_16_21,"And we'll make that more visible as we get closer to it. It's intended to have similar long run and the impact as it relates to bringing focus to our priority brands in that market. It's an excellent risky market; it seems from at least a few of our vantage point to be turning the corner as it relates to their economy and their exposable income relative to what they've been experiencing in the prior few years. So we think it could be well timed to go and make this move, which is familiar terrain for us. And in each instance they've been differently scaled, investments and operations, and as we get closer we'll get the visibility to it. ",Paul Varga,,57,,,
_may29abi_Q4_16_15,"And just to follow-up from your first questions, on the other hand, when we look at '17 with the public information we have, not giving any guidance, but when you read what's out there in terms of macro numbers and what the economists are saying and predicting, we see some facts and some prediction. We see, for example, that inflation continues to go down. So that's a good thing for consumers in general and for us. We see that consumers -- the economists are talking about the GDP to be flat to two consecutive years of declines. So, again, not great news for GDP but much better than we have in the past two years, unemployment also being forecasted to start with reverting in the second half of the year and as consequences disposal income likely to resume growth towards the end of the year again after two very tough years. So, and in this environment that's what we said about be cautiously optimistic about Brazil in terms of beer industry for '17, especially for the second half of the year. So along with that you have the COGS per hectoliter that will evolve throughout the year given that we had our hedges in place and those hedges will get a better place as we go through the quarters especially in second half. So that also will benefit year.",Carlos Brito,,58,,,
may31_TAP_Q1_16_5,"Yeah. Sure. I mean, to your point, Mark, I think, we could spend a lot of the time doing individual diagnosis on 11 different countries. I think, the theme that I will point you to is that, in general, we are increasing our investments in marketing and those investments are playing out well for us with stronger volumes, stronger revenues and premiumizing that portfolio. And actually, that's a factor virtually across all the markets.",Simon Cox,,59,,,
_BrownF.B_Q1_16_51,"Thanks, Paul and just one follow-up and I think you might have addressed this in an earlier question. But just, when you talk about intensifying competition in the US, you are talking about just a lot of new products hitting the market, not price competition or discounting?",Paul Varga,,60,,,
_may31_TSRYY_17_23,And so there's no desperation for us to try and hurriedly sell that inventory. I'd rather do this in a disciplined way and I think that's probably most important word is we are disciplined in how we are approaching the allocation of the lines both Luxury/Masstige on an annual basis and also across regions and channels.,Michael Clarke,,61,,,

may29_DEO_q4_16_28,"Mitch, on scotch pricing, we're going to manage this very, very closely, and it's very market specific. But the broad principles I would say generally in deluxe scotch and above, I don't see us rolling back price. In standard and primary scotches in certain markets where, if we've got currency benefits and we're uncompetitive, we will make adjustments. But then on the other hand, in so-called hard currency markets, like the U.S., I expect our scotch margins to really improve. So we manage it on a global basis. We manage global pricing very tightly.",Ivan Menezes,,63,,,
_BrownF.B_Q1_16_6,"Yes, so, just to give you a flavor, I noted a number of 67% of off-premise distribution for Fire as it related to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. As a point of reference, Honey is 81%, and so we know we've got that opportunity to get there as well, as in terms of its on-premise while we've gotten faster in the on-premise, the ratio of Tennessee Honey to Whiskey and Fire to Whiskey is got opportunity to - I mentioned 30% of Honey on the on-premise and - excuse me, Fire on the on-premise and Honey is, I think 39%.

But taxes can change every month, as it did last year. So again, net-net, there is some cycle to be done. VAT is still ahead of price. Market share, if we grew ahead of the industry, should be building those options for us.",Carlos Brito,,67,,,
ay29const_Q4_17_52,"I think so you're going to see a little expansion there. I would say that from an SG&A and marketing perspective, you can assume that that's a percentage of sales, that will remain consistent year-over-year. I will say however considering a lot of other consumer products companies talking about the work that they're doing to take cost out of their business, we're doing all of that same work with a view of being able to redeploy resources to initiatives that are going to continue to drive the topline growth of our business.",Rob Sands,,68,,,
_BrownF.B_Q2_16_20,"We don't like to see other people get consumption that we don't have, but when you have, as our company does today, in our largest markets something like a 6% or 5% market share, and when you have across the globe less than 1% of the market share, you're going to be really frustrated for a long time if you measure yourself on that basis. So we think we can be an enormously successful company, building value for shareholders without having to dominate any particular category or segment. ",Paul Varga,,69,,,
_may31_TSRYY_17_5,"So, we're continuing to focus on how we launched one portfolio at a time and we will probably share more details with you on other potential portfolios at the Investor Day but that's the way you should think about it which means that as you start cycling through the resetting and you start cycling the growth region upon region, you're getting incredible economies of scale with regard to these brands being global, you're getting the margin accretion on those brands but you don't have to keep having resetting the brand portfolio as you go forward.",Michael Clarke,,70,,,

It's in the high 18s as we sit here today.",David Klein,,72,,,
may31_TAP_Q4_16_17,Robert some of the big retailers have modified their assortment strategies just address out of stocks and to improve inventory turn. We believe that's the inevitable evolution as Mark said the number of SKUs that been added to the beer category over the past two years so overall we actually agree with that. And in some areas I would say that it has improved our positioning and in some areas it hasn't I think it's coming into 2017 we'll us is that. In its totality. But it's a strategy that we agree with because focus to core packages and provides a healthy balance between out of stocks and variety. ,Mark Hunter,,73,,,
_BrownF.B_Q3_16_35,"I don't think it would be in the best interest of Brown-Forman's long-term value creation to take our eye off of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in pursuit of trying to improve Early Times, for example. They are both great brands in their own right, but Jack Daniel's is decidedly more important at Brown-Forman. And so it's something that we would continue to prioritize.",Paul Varga,,74,,,
_may29abi_Q2_16_14,"So the fact that our volume -- the fact that industry volume in China is negative, it's all on the core and value brands or core and value segment brands and that is where the negative is all. If you look at the core-plus, premium and super-premium, they are of course not growing at the same speed they were before, but they're still growing and that's where we have most of our volume anyway. But we still have a 34% of our volumes in non- or below core-plus brands, so core and value. That is why our volume is being impacted, not because of the core-plus brands of ours, premium or super-premium.",Carlos Brito,,75,,,
_BrownF.B_Q4_16_16,"You kind of answered your question. I agree with you, I think there are always strategic considerations. Look we don't have the largest portfolio by any means, and so as a general bias we are brand builders versus brand sellers. And I really do feel like almost any brand in our portfolio we're going decide to do the best job we can with it, and often times they do play strategic roles. ",Paul Varga,,76,,,
_may29abi_Q4_16_43,"Well, in terms of revenue opportunities within SABMiller, I think, one, I mean, we always said that we saw revenue opportunities, we saw core working capital opportunities, but we are not putting a number to it, but we always said that on the revenue side, Robert, global brands was a clear opportunity.",Carlos Brito,,77,,,
ay29const_Q3_17_3,"Yes. So in terms of on-premise and off-premise, our beer business is up high single digits in the on-premise. We think the market's down low to mid single digits in the on-premise. So we are gaining share and feeling very, very comfortable there.",David Klein,,78,,,
_may29abi_Q4_16_18,"In terms of Bud Light, I mean, what's happened in the U.S. is the two prong approach to sales and marketing money. I mean, yes, we continue to invest behind Bud and Bud Light, because those are very important, its core lagers for us in the U.S., but a lot of new money that we're putting in the business are going towards Michelob Ultra, Stella Artois, the craft portfolio.

That is not only geared towards innovations; the total marketing and sales support spend, where we say we will slightly increase it.

ay29const_Q2_17_7,"Yeah. I don't think that that's really a relevant sort of measure. It's not competing in high-end spirits per se, right? It's really a brand by brand kind of thing. We're going to compete and out-compete the competition with the brands that we have. The whole point of sort of our selection process as we make these sort of smaller tuck-in acquisitions is to buy brands that stand on their own and have the momentum to be of a scale to contribute materially to Constellation's growth and margins. And I am quite confident that High West will be one of those brands as are the other brands in our spirits portfolio. So just like we bought SVEDKA years ago and have grown that to be the second largest vodka in the entire United States and the number one import brand and fundamentally changed the vodka category with that brand, I think that our other spirits additions have a lot of great potential similar to that. So, I guess we don't really think about the - how do we compete effectively in a whole category. We think about what's the quality of the brands that we're buying and how can they contribute to Constellation's continued stellar growth in the top line and the bottom line.",Robert Sands,,88,,,

We have issued a Director to our team that you will stop on the bond sales with immediate effect.

And then if you looked at year-to-date pricing for our top ten SKUs in the premium category, meaning Woodbridge and above, we're at plus 3.5%.

Underlying depletions, as you know, we ended the year strong. The second half was stronger than the first half. I expect that momentum to continue into fiscal '16.

But on an ongoing basis, steady state, we do see the US, even from its high base, it's got all the characteristics of -- to drive margin expansion, modest, on an ongoing basis, but I want to retain the flexibility to invest behind the U.S., to really shore up the top-line momentum in a sustainable basis.",Ivan Menezes,,126,,,
31_Pernod_Q1_16_24,"In the U.S. Absolut is clearly improving its performance. In volumes terms last year we were down 5%, this year we're not far from stability, so that's I would say a very significant improvement. The minus 2% are in value, so you have a value evolution which is slightly more negative than the volume evolution because of our decision to slightly adjust the net price of Absolut in the U.S. on a state-by-state, SKU-by-SKU basis. And the good thing is that we believe that today we have a far more efficient commercial and pricing policy than what we had in the past. That's obviously not the only reason for that improvement, we have worked a lot on stronger activation on the field in Absolut and leveraging the addition resources we got from our wholesalers.",Gilles Bogaert,,127,,,

If you think back four or five years ago, a lot of people were dependent upon the emerging markets for growth, whereas their developed international markets may not have been growing as robustly. In the U.S., they could expect maybe industry competitive levels of the growth, but the emerging markets were really helping drive them. ",Paul Varga,,128,,,

But the way we approach share repurchases is opportunistically, so we're looking into it as an investment, so you saw us buy a significant amount in our second quarter where we felt like the market wasn't understanding and realizing some of the underlying growth that we see in our business and how we see it going forward, and it was being masked somewhat by foreign exchange. But we don't have a target for that for the year, if you will, so it's more opportunistic.

_BrownF.B_Q2_17_19,"Yes. I would agree, we hear them, but it would just be too early for us to see anything that would make that. I mean so in essence, it makes it more a hypothesis than the reality. I think some of the more. I would say systemic things that relate to particularly our business, which is not the food part, of course as much as it is the drink part of the restaurant business. I think I haven't heard anything that makes me change that, which is this aspect of going back now several, several years where consumer started to subtly shift their consumption occasions toward the off-premise more. And there seems to be more millennial thing, the ability particularly to use social media to gather people effectively starting your own small bar on an evening if you want, because it's so efficient to do so. And the impact that, that then has on suppliers and brands as you try to navigate the marketplace where the off-premise is growing faster than the on-premise. And so what are those dynamics. I actually think it will be really interesting to see how particularly one of the more recent developments that came out of this year's election cycle, which was continued momentum on the legalization of marijuana, that being an interesting development, of course, with something we have been monitoring. But what - just this will be again an anecdotal thing, the fact that, that tends to be more of an off-premise consumption occasion, actually and to the extent that there is cross-category usage between marijuana and beverage alcohol, what does that do in terms of its impact on a brand or a suppliers approach to the business. I mean, it - I think that development will if anything add even greater momentum to the off-premise sales versus the on-premise sales. So, these are all things that are kind of speculative, quite honestly, their hypotheses that we are observing after. We are monitoring them. I do think our organization has done a nice job on trying to cater to the off-premise occasion a bit more, whether it's through special packs, item such as the development of flavored whiskey category, I think hits a sweet spot as it relates to convenience in terms of consumption. I think as it relates to price and volume trade-offs, I think certainly the off-premise environment is a more price-sensitive channel than the on-premise one. And so there is a number of attributes of the channels that you have to pay attention to as you see subtle. These have not been wholesale and dramatic shifts. They are much more subtle, but if you study them over maybe 3 or 5 or 7 years, they become more important than they do in any one quarter. So that's about all we have observed as it relates to the questions you were asking. We will be paying close attention to though it of course as the months unfold and the realities of what's prognosticated actually come into play.",Paul Varga,,178,,,

_BrownF.B_Q1_16_25,"Yes, I think, you'll find us being fairly focused relative to our competition on particular trademarks and probably most direct response to the interest that's out there in Mezcal is that our response would be to focus ever more on Herradura.

We think it can be a very significant piece of business for us in due course. It's actually showing nice traction of late and we think that interest in Mezcal might create interest as well on the Tequila category because of the flavor profile. But to your point, I think it would be short-sighted on our part not to pay attention to emerging categories and see how they might impose competitive tension or distraction for our brands in the marketplace and these have come from time-to-time whether they are Mezcal or the Cachacas or the Japanese Whiskies are showing some - in this country some interest.

_BrownF.B_Q3_17_30,"Part of what we did in December with our investor conference, we looked out, I think, to 2025, for the most part, the ambitions we'll have there, we will have pretty much, by the time you get out to 2019, 2020, 2021, you're going to have to had that product in the barrel in the case of tequila in the ground with the agave plants. So I actually just always - and just a reminded to everybody who covers this industry, you have to make those forecasts in advance, and those plans, building the warehouses, putting the barreled inventory, become part of your, they have to sync up with the ambitions that you're expressing. So part of why I said that is that we continue to be pretty bullish about what we see for the opportunity for Jack Daniel's and American whiskey and our premium tequilas, some of these new products we've bought out to that time frame, despite the fact that you might have challenging circumstances around any 90 or 180 day period.",Paul Varga,,189,,,
ay29const_Q1_17_8,"Yes. So in the quarter, yeah, I don't have that number. We can get back to you with the specific number for the quarter.",David Klein,,190,,,
ay29const_Q3_16_46,"Well, I think so. I think you'll see trading up on wine is accelerating and I think that you'll continue to see it be extremely robust and I think that you'll continue to see us benefit from that trading up.",Rob Sands,,191,,,
_BrownF.B_Q4_16_13,"It's a little more outside the United States, if it gives you any indication. And we're in no hurry to go get as, I think Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, it took us the better part of four years plus to get to where - I'm going rough this number, we're something like in 80 countries where we're doing most of the business for Tennessee Honey today, and I don't anticipate us getting that fast this fiscal year even and the next two fiscal years on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. We're fighting in a market at a time to see where there seems to be appeal. ",Paul Varga,,192,,,
ay29const_Q3_16_29,"Well, we obviously are giving guidance for our next fiscal year, but we don't see anything impeding our Ballast Point performance in general. There will continue to be expanded distribution and Ballast Point continues to increase its velocity per point of distribution even in its major markets where its already a big brand like its old market in San Diego.",Rob Sands,,193,,,
ay29const_Q3_16_11,"So obviously the multiple that we paid for it in relationship to the growth is actually a pretty reasonable purchase price, right. As you recall from my initial comments, the brand grew over 100% this year and 125% in IRI.",Rob Sands,,194,,,
may29_DEO_q2_15_37,"And clearly, the other factor we have helping us is we will be driving premiumization of that portfolio. So even in the results announced, the prestige and above categories at USL grew 17% and, as you know, we have catch-up to do there because the last five, seven years, USL didn't perform very well in that space, as one of our competitors did. And so we fully -- our strategy is very much to rebuilding our position in prestige and above and I'm encouraged by the momentum there. And that's margin accretive.",Ivan Menezes,,195,,,
_the_Pres_09_16_33,"I'll just give you a flavor of a couple of areas where we expect to deliver benefits this year. Firstly, zero-based budgeting. Our FY17 planning process has embraced zero-based budgeting to increase both efficiency and effectiveness of our indirect overhead spend. This is expected to deliver a 13% reduction in indirect during this year.",John Kennedy,,196,,,
may31_TAP_Q2_16_2,"Just to give you greater transparency in terms of what the CapEx would be excluding that, because it's obviously a very large CapEx project and we didn't want that number to be just offering all of the number, plus the proceeds of Vancouver are not in the free cash flow number.",Mauricio Restrepo,,197,,,
ay29const_Q3_17_25,"And the details of everything else and all of the puts and takes with everything else. I mean, we wouldn't just totally disrupt the supply chain over the long run if it's not necessary. But we do have quite a bit of flexibility in what we can do. So hence our optimism obviously relative to this whole matter and as also evidenced by our view on our own stock value and our buyback activity.",Rob Sands,,198,,,
y31_HEINY_Q4_14_10," No, I don't know where you are referring to that we said acquisitions is a priority. I think what we always say -- the beer industry is consolidating and is probably not fully at the end of the consolidation. And we have been and we will be an active player in that.",Rene Hooft Graafland,,199,,,
ay29const_Q2_16_16,"None whatsoever. We're actually pretty happy with the progress we made in the build out at Nava. In fact, we've now run beer down our premium glass line. So for the first time, we put labels and foil on bottles because our previous production have been Corona, primarily Corona Extra and Corona Light using the applied ceramic label bottles.",David Klein,,200,,,
ay29const_Q4_16_5,"It is an interesting business, it's got strong growth. We built an improved market share in Canada. So we think that it represents in many respects a great standalone opportunity. As far as its implications as to our strategy for the rest of the wine and spirits business, there really is no implication there.",Rob Sands,,201,,,
_the_Pres_09_16_8,"It is not only about adding more sales people, it is also about the improved capabilities and effectiveness of the sales force through rigorous training programs and extensive use of automation tools. These tools allow us to make quicker and better decisions based off daily reported measures on sales out, key distribution points and merchandising execution. We also see further opportunities in the future through better delivery of what we call the perfect store by sub-channel and a focus on distributor management. I believe we will derive more benefit here in FY17. We have the coverage but we can still improve our precision of knowing exactly what is the right format, visibility and price point by different outlet type.",John Kennedy,,202,,,
_the_Pres_09_16_62,"Then on Brexit, we're not complacent about Brexit, and do believe that, medium term, there are things that we need to be tuned into. Our current trading does not show any significant downturn, either in GB or on the continent. In terms of our confidence in this year's fiscal plan, it remains. But it is something that we're staying very close to.",John Kennedy,,203,,,
may31_TAP_Q1_16_30,"But, we've been on the journey to build a footprint over the course of the last five years, in particular, led by Coors Light and more recently by Staropramen and that will continue. I'm not going to comment specifically on any M&A opportunities. We never do, as you're aware. But we need to play to win in both the U.S., Canada, and in our European business. And we need to continue to build our global footprint, led through our global brands, that's principally been on an asset-light license and export model. It's likely that model will continue as we look to take Coors trademark, Staropramen trademark in the future of the Miller trademark into more markets, that's probably all I can say at this stage.",Mark R. Hunter,,204,,,
31_Pernod_Q2_17_5,"So today it's still difficult to say obviously we will adapt as we start seeing more with more clarity what's happening there, but again there are a lot of question marks what is really a highway and how we - basically how we're going to transport point of sale in outlets to outside of this parameter and what will be the reaction of local states.",Alexandre Ricard,,205,,,
31_Pernod_Q2_17_22,"Well on Brazil. Yes minus 10% it's partly negatively impacted by zero we had last year ahead of the tax increase. That's in the market is still down and we are down enormously 9% with the markets. For the next 12 months we would expect against the macroeconomic indicators that things could get better thing gross GDP gross is plan to come back in Brazil we've been able to increase our prices, so we're hopefully in the next 12 months will we start to see some improvement there and I think we've done a good job on our key strategic brands there Absolut, Chivas and Ballantine's. We getting shares in the last few years on the most of all brands, so our intention is to keep growing those brands there.",Alexandre Ricard,,206,,,
_BrownF.B_Q3_17_26,"That's something we - I mean, for the most part, don't particularly participate in, those sort of - I'd say, value level or slightly lower pricing than the premium level where we are. We have not tended to be in those. So for us, recoveries in emerging markets would be most directly related to any momentum built around premium whiskey. And in our case, it'll be led by Jack Daniel's.",Paul Varga,,207,,,
_BrownF.B_Q3_16_42,"But it still presents the same question, how do we, in year six and beyond, in the United States, continue to build the brand in a way that competes better versus what the competitive references are out there? So it's the - for our Brown-Forman employees who are listening, that's the question we're focused on. Yes, it really is. I mean, it's very true.",Paul Varga,,208,,,
