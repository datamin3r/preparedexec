#	Title: Scraping Alpha
#	Version: 1.0
#	Author: Ben Goldsworthy <b.goldsworthy@lancaster.ac.uk>
#
#	This file is a part of Scraping Alpha, a series of scripts to scrape
#	earnings call transcripts from seekingalpha.com and present them as useful
#	SQL.
#
#	This file is the webspider that Scrapy uses to retrieve the information from
#	the website. Left unattended, it will scrape all 4,000+ pages of results.
#	
#	To interrupt this behaviour and still be able to proceed with the other
#	steps, cancel the script with CTRL+Z. This will likely leave an unfinished
#	JSON item at the end of the output file. To clear this up, open the file
#	in vim and type the following keys: 
#		'G', 'V', 'd', '$', 'i', 'BACKSPACE', 'ENTER', ']', 'ESC', ':wp', 'ENTER'
#	This will truncate the file at the last complete record and seal it off.
#
# 	For installation instructions for Scrapy, visit 
# 	<doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html>. This file should be in the
# 	`spiders` directory of the project, and is run via 'scrapy crawl transcripts 
# 	-o transcripts.json' at the command line (the output file will be placed
#	in the directory the Terminal is currently in).
