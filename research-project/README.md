[The Prepared Executive: A Linguistic Exploration of Executive Answers in the Q&A Section of  Earnings Calls](the_prepared_executive_v1.0.pdf)

Earnings calls provide a stage for senior executives to present information to financial analysts. The interactive setting of the call's  question and answer section offers an opportunity to explore executives style of answering analyst questions. This study examines linguistic features in executive answers and investigates how these features might be proxies for detecting executive preparedness. The motivation is to discover hitherto unknown facets of the executive through their language. A sample of call transcripts is used to obtain the executive answers. A domain expert participates in labelling a sample to provide a ground truth. Word lists and document similarity models, using Natural language processing and latent similarity analysis techniques, measure the proxy features of uncertainty, avoidance and repetition. The feature models' results are combined to yield the executive's answer as prepared or unprepared. Model performance is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, F1 measure and Cohen's Kappa. The results show the models performance is inconsistent detecting these feature in comparison to the domain expert. However, the models finding a small amount of the sough-after features may warrant a closer inspection to discover executive divulgence.

"The Prepared Executive" document above contains an appendix which describes the configuration and process to follow to recreate the study's
environment, preparation of data, creating the sample spreadsheet of executive answers for annotation, executing the models to evaluate their performance.
