The python scripts to prep the data which must be run in this order are :

unwinder\_exec\_anal\_v1.0.py

extractExecUttersEach\_v1.0.py 

The annotated experiment folder contains python files to create a dataset for annotaion using the output from the data prep stage.

Once the source data is produced the models can be run 
to measure 
uncertainty and avoidance : annotatedExecAnsPerformance.py
repetition and unpreparedness : test\_execSentSim.py
